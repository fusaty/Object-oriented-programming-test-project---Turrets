# Object-oriented-programming-test-project---Turrets

This is a simple school project to implement an object-oriented programming turret system. The system allows users to create and manage turrets for different types of weapons, such as machine guns, cannons, and missiles.

The project uses object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide a flexible and extensible way to manage turrets.

This project is a good example of how object-oriented programming can be used to create complex software systems in a modular and reusable way.
